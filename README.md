We made this comprehensive tutorial to solving Discrete Logarithm Problems with CADO-NFS either on Google Colab or Runpod Cloud because the CADO-NFS documentation is scarce.
This guide accompanies the article [CADO-NFS DLP Comprehensive Tutorial](https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/cado-nfs-dlp-comprehensive-tutorial)

- Absolute beginners should follow the Google Colab notebook.
- 10x gigachad devs follow the Runpod/Local Ubuntu path.
