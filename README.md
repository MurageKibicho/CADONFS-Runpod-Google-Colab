# Solving Discrete Logarithm Problems with CADO-NFS either on Google Colab or Runpod Cloud

CADO-NFS is the world’s best factoring and discrete logarithm problem (DLP) solver. However, the documentation is scarce.

This are my personal scripts to get CADO-NFS running on Google Colab or Runpod.

- Absolute beginners should follow the Google Colab notebook.
- 10x gigachad devs follow the Runpod/Local Ubuntu path.

The article [CADO-NFS DLP Comprehensive Tutorial](https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/cado-nfs-dlp-comprehensive-tutorial) is an extremely deep guide to what each script does.

Outside Google Colab these are commmon errors encountered with CADO-NFS:
1. g++ version errors.
2. cmake version errors.
3. Python Flask venv errors.
4. Localhost 404's CADO-NFS errors.
5. Failed individual logarithm errors.
6. Distributed computing in the relation collection phase.

I demonstrate workarounds in the [CADO-NFS DLP article](https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/cado-nfs-dlp-comprehensive-tutorial).
